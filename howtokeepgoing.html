        <p>It's essential to cultivate a deep love for the manga to keep drawing a manga. 
            When drawing manga makes you feeling fatigued or overwhelmed, turn to the mangas that hold a special place in your heart. 
            Reconnecting with the stories you love can reignite your passion, inspiring thoughts like, "I want to draw something like this!," or "I want to create a narrative like this!". 
            Don't underestimate the power of varied experiences. 
            Even seemingly unrelated experiences can spark creativity. 
            Embrace diverse experiences, since they all contribute to an inspiration for your work. 
            Don't be afraid to experience new things, and fail due to trying out new things. 
            Even failing experience will help you(imagine when you build a character who despairs due to constant failure! Your feelings and experiences will help!). 
            Don't pressure yourself nor criticize yourself too much. 
            You are your best companion, you are the one who can love your work more than any other people(You will be creating a manga that fits your taste. 
            So there is no way that you cannot love your own work!). 
            Always seek for fun!
