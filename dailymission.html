                  <h4> 
                        Instructions:</h4>

                        <p>1. Begin your day by jotting down memorable episodes that occurred to you. If there aren't any noteworthy personal experiences, choose a scene from a TV show or sitcom (preferably avoiding movie scenes due to their length).</p> 
                        
                        <p> 2. Utilize the morning exercise to create a 2-page spread manga illustrating the situation you noted earlier. Dedicate 50 minutes to this daily practice.</p> 
                        
                        <p>3. Initiate the drawing process without relying on words to describe the situation. Focus on using actions, settings, onomatopoeia, and drawing. Perhaps get your inspirations from silent films.</p>
                        
                        <p>4. As you become more proficient, consider the reading flow from left to right and top to bottom. Integrate text bubbles strategically and add words/lines to enhance the narrative.</p> 
                        
                        <p>This daily routine will not only improve your manga drawing skills but also sharpen your ability to convey stories visually.</p>&nbsp;
